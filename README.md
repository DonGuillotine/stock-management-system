# Stock Management System.
I have developed a stock management system using Django, a web-based application that allows me to track and manage inventory levels, orders, sales, sales history, analytics and deliveries as well as keeping track of user's activities.

<h3>The Authentication System ensures secure access to the application through unique credentials and a forgot password functionality.</h3>

<h3>A beautiful and responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface for all users, with the added convenience of switching between a light and dark mode.</h3>
